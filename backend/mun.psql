For me, the most appealing factor of court is that it is not merely a heated debate with two sides to choose from: approval or opposition. I expect to be able , along with other minds, address a matter by open solutions, and try to find yet another option aside from a simple yes or no.		2014 HSMUN Security Council (Nigeria)	["Friend"]				67050	2015/08/04		0		立法院	2015-06-18 10:53:11.449947	2015-10-04 21:12:26.1843	0	0	A229314237	曾衣香	0937889669	\N

I come from Italy and lately there has been a lot of talk about the Mediterrean immigrants and refugees. I have also noticed that their human rights are considered secondary in front of the political issue these people represent.	Unfortunately, I haven't had any opportunity to simulate a court before. I strongly expect that these simulations will be similar to conferences involving two or more parties debating on a topic, in which debates should make emerge the most suitable solution/s for the questions issued.		This is my first Model UN Conference and I do not have experience with any public speaking. However, according to my current studies, I am to be trained as an interpreter; plus I'd like to become a conference interpreter, so I'm looking forward to this particular experience.

I believe we all will learn how global society works politically, economically, socially and culturally by experiencing a simulation of court. Above all, what I sincerely expect from this simulation is an international connection with people from different background and I know this opportunity will be  one of my turning point in my 20s.		This will be my first Model UN Conference to participate in. Since it is said that we can learn what Model UN conference is with a real experience, I would love to do a new challenge to start with TWMUN. I am officially an engineering student at my college, however, I have studied different fields such as economics and politics while staying abroad in Hungary and Mexico for two times of exchange programs. Throughout all the lectures I took so far, I could have chances to do some researches about various global issues and to debate with other students during the class. Hopefully these academic experiences will help me widely in this upcoming conference. Additionally while I was staying in Hungary as a exchange student, I did a presentation on the subject of education for sustainable development through UNESCO work camp at students' scientific conference and that presentation was totally based on my own 20 sheet of research paper.

While preparing for the presentation, I spent a lot of time looking through his biography and his claims. The effort I put into the project really made me realize how important human rights are and drove me to further look into the topic even after finishing my project.	No I haven't, and I wonder if the simulation involves the jury or not. If so, then it should play out similar to what we see from movies, where the jury's verdict may affect the judge's ruling. If not, the jury have full control of the court. Either way, the debate between the prosecutor and the lawyer will be the main focus of the simulation, and if the topic is controversial, it could lead to dispute and coming to an agreement could be difficult.		Last year my friends and I participated in a competition known as the Taiwan Young-Student Physicist's Tournament, or TYPT for short. It involves doing research and experiments prior to the tournament, and presenting your conclusion in the form of debate, using English only. It gave me a chance to learn to convey my ideas to others and cooperate with my teammates, making this the highlight of my high school life. Even though we ended up losing, the experience itself was worth more than any award.	["Friend"]	I'm a little bit hot tempered, so I may sometimes sound irritated and talk with a high volume.

Besides, I enhanced my public speaking ability during last summer since I participated in Camp Blue which provided an English-only environment and also offered several opportunities for us to practice English public speaking ability. Furthermore, I took a course called Journalistic English, and this course also gave me a chance to rehearse speaking.	["Friend", "Facebook", "Website", "MUN clubs in school", "School posts"]	Although I do not have experience with Model UN Conferences, I will do my best and try to overcome every difficulties and challenges during Mun. Moreover, I have prepared for TOEFL iBT, so I am convinced that my speaking ability can afford this activity. I will work hard and seize every chances occurring in my life.			31566	2015/09/26		0		立法院	2015-09-25 02:36:30.955959	2015-10-02 19:45:02.018276	0	1	E124806410	謝蕙朱	0961183398	\N

The university life gives me the opportunities to enlarge my life experience and to develop my critical competence. With great interest in the study of language, I had the chance to be admitted in LungHwa University of Science and Technology’s excellent program. As part of the requirements, I lived and study in America for a semester; so far I had the opportunity to experience about the American life from observing my peers, my professors, and the general environment. \r\n\tCompared to the college, my graduate school life is more colorful and meaningful. I participated in many students’ clubs, including volunteer service learning, English performance, and study group. I really learn much from these groups and made friends with a lot of people from different backgrounds. Through the cooperation and exchange with them, I realized that there are so many special people in the world so that everyone has to be humble and open-minded. On the other hand, I tried to figure out how to do the meaningful learning on my studies. There are many differences between college and graduate school life, I knew that it is a treasury here, but how can I find the key to opening it? I began to ponder on my learning attitudes and styles. In order to learn some professional counseling skills, I worked in cram school as a part-time job, and then to be a teaching assistant there. Through this previous experience, I realized how working was, learned how to react to students and talk to children’s parents and on the phone. Through this part-time job, I understand myself much better and I decided to be a teacher in the future. In this way, I not only can continue my English learning, but also I can devote myself to education.

["Friend", "Facebook"]	Ahavat Israel in Taiwan(AIIT) is a group of people led by Master Lin Rang, who loves the Jewish people from Israel unconditionally.   Decades ago, he was enlightened to know the importance and distinctiveness of the Jewish people.   Ever since then, he has conveyed the same belief to his followers with his lifelong mission to love God's chosen people.    \r\n  To love the Jewish people is not only an idea but also an action.   For years,Master Lin has been developing the thermal therapy which is far beyond any contemporary medical treatments.  And the therapy is, as Master Lin has developed, solely for the Jewish people.   The treatment has then been applied to many Jewish people and their families both in Taiwan and Israel and proved very effective by them.   \r\n   What I, Master Lin's follower , has been doing derives from my  love for Master Lin as well as the Jewish people.  I firmly believe in Master Lin's teachings  as his wisdom and his assessment has helped us tremendously in any given situation.     The benefits I've received from his teachings in all the aspects of our lives are indescribable.    I am grateful to have him as my teacher and thus gladly and faithfully do what he always tells us to.						0		立法院	2015-06-01 22:16:56.901273	2015-10-23 09:02:23.279262	0	0	A227052583	CHANG HORNG,YA-CHYN	0912099531	\N

Although i have never be a delegate at any model conference, but i was a worker in THMUN(Tsing-Hua MUN) during 7/9~7/14 at Tsing-Hua University. And i was a host who was responsible for social event and the member of the activity section. During the social event, i needed to talk a lot not only to control all the situation, but also the accidental condition. On the other hand, i also joined YMCA oversea voluntary program in Vietnam, which had to spend time to communicate with the local volunteers who also spoke English. So this is my personal experience about my public speaking and international experience. So you like it.

This is my first Model UN Conference. I major in English Department, as a result, there are many resources for me to train my English. To illustrate, I took a program which called "chat corner". It is held daily and provides the opportunity for local and international students to interact and converse, even do the language exchange. Thanks for the program, I can improve my foreign language ability and gain a better understanding of overseas cultures.\r\n\tIn addition, for the oral training class, I also had the Cross-Culture Distance Learning with Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. I used English as an international language and discussed various topics online in small groups. This class not only let me communicate with people whose backgrounds are different from my own, but also taught me how important to be open-minded to the differences between individuals and between cultures.\r\n\tFurthermore, I attended the 8th and 9th International Student Forum with Waseda University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Yonsei University and Korea University. During those student's presentations such as "What does diploma mean to us?" and "How does your country use soft power?" I learned how to develop negotiating skills that are useful and build up ability to present my view in public.	["Facebook", "School posts"]	In the school, I also be a member of a school club which called "Tamkang University Goodwill Ambassador". As a 17th Public Relation Administration and 18th Director, I always proactively take participation in international affairs like taking a courtesy visit to Malaysian Friendship and Trade Centre on 28 November 2014 then learn more about diplomatic and trade missions from His Excellency Ambassador Datuk T.S.

From this visiting, I really explored my global perspective forward this modern world and started to find out my special personalities on creating attractive conversation.  \r\n\tMoreover, I had various experiences on being a receptionist from my school club because we usually have to do campus or library guide in English for those scholars and students came from our sister schools. Specifically, we hosted a hi-tea reception for University of Macau Public Relations Student Ambassador on 26 June 2015.

Since then, I began to love public speaking. Besides, I also took part in the BM forum.In this activity, I felt quite happy because I could be the representative to compete in an BM competition. So, my public speaking even furthered after finishing high school. I grew this sense of ability to speak in front of large crowds and present awards and other things to people while so many are watching me.  It was an amazing feeling.

I possess strong experience in discussing human rights-related topics. For instance, during the course spanning one month, we would hold weekly discussions with the teacher about the importance of human rights, pressing issues regarding women’s rights and how to raise awareness about children’s rights. Also, I would term myself as a dynamic youngster who has a deep passion for volunteering. In fact, I have previously volunteered by teaching English to the poor children in Chongqing (China) and Siem Reap (Cambodia). I do not solely limit myself to discussions about human rights, but through volunteering, I concretize the dreams of these children. In other words, I act as a middleman to ensure they are enjoying one of the fundamental human rights; which is access to education. Moreover, I also seize my English-teaching volunteering as an opportunity to educate these children about their rights. In addition to, driven by my passion to create a better world, I have attended extra lectures about the theme of “poverty” at the University of Hong Kong where I had the opportunity to discuss about human rights with the Professors. I equally enrolled in a course called “Poverty, Development and Challenges for the Next Generation” where I wrote articles about human rights and I also participated in a poverty-alleviating project. In the end, I scored an A in that course. Furthermore, I am the winner of an essay competition about “The challenges and rights of women entrepreneurs in Mauritius”. The competition was organized by the National Women Entrepreneur Council of Mauritius in 2010.	No, I have never played a simulation of court before. However, I am very keen to learn and experience it. During my internship at the United Nations, I have had the chance to attend some conferences and witness how they function. I expect that the simulation will enable be to put into practice my team management skills, sharpen my communication skills, demonstrate an innovative approach to problem solving, make use of my analytical skills and profound theoretical knowledge of Economics and Finance acquired throughout my undergraduate studies and learn more about the functioning of the United Nations system.		This is my first MUN Conference. I am an active member of Toastmasters club at the University of Hong Kong. As a club member, I engage in debates about various international issues on a weekly basis. As a result, I have been able to acquire strong public debating and speaking skills. Moreover, during my internship at the United Nations office in Geneva, I was conducting research on ways to develop a benchmarking framework to improve the financial and managerial efficiencies of the United Nations system. I was equally undertaking research about the recent projects undertaken by the United Nations’ member countries in order to reduce the adverse effects of climate change. My research performance was highly valued by my supervisors.	["Facebook"]	I look forward to be part of the Taiwan Model United Nations Conference and contribute to its smooth running.
