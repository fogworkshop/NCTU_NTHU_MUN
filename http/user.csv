I possess strong experience in discussing human rights-related topics. For instance, during the course spanning one month, we would hold weekly discussions with the teacher about the importance of human rights, pressing issues regarding women’s rights and how to raise awareness about children’s rights. Also, I would term myself as a dynamic youngster who has a deep passion for volunteering. In fact, I have previously volunteered by teaching English to the poor children in Chongqing (China) and Siem Reap (Cambodia). I do not solely limit myself to discussions about human rights, but through volunteering, I concretize the dreams of these children. In other words, I act as a middleman to ensure they are enjoying one of the fundamental human rights; which is access to education. Moreover, I also seize my English-teaching volunteering as an opportunity to educate these children about their rights. In addition to, driven by my passion to create a better world, I have attended extra lectures about the theme of “poverty” at the University of Hong Kong where I had the opportunity to discuss about human rights with the Professors. I equally enrolled in a course called “Poverty, Development and Challenges for the Next Generation” where I wrote articles about human rights and I also participated in a poverty-alleviating project. In the end, I scored an A in that course. Furthermore, I am the winner of an essay competition about “The challenges and rights of women entrepreneurs in Mauritius”. The competition was organized by the National Women Entrepreneur Council of Mauritius in 2010.","youshnajee1@hotmail.com","No, I have never played a simulation of court before.

This is my first Model UN Conference. I major in English Department, as a result, there are many resources for me to train my English. To illustrate, I took a program which called "chat corner". It is held daily and provides the opportunity for local and international students to interact and converse, even do the language exchange. Thanks for the program, I can improve my foreign language ability and gain a better understanding of overseas cultures. 	In addition, for the oral training class, I also had the Cross-Culture Distance Learning with Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. I used English as an international language and discussed various topics online in small groups. This class not only let me communicate with people whose backgrounds are different from my own, but also taught me how important to be open-minded to the differences between individuals and between cultures. 	Furthermore, I attended the 8th and 9th International Student Forum with Waseda University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Yonsei University and Korea University. During those student's presentations such as "What does diploma mean to us?" and "How does your country use soft power?" I learned how to develop negotiating skills that are useful and build up ability to present my view in public.","In the school, I also be a member of a school club which called "Tamkang University Goodwill Ambassador". As a 17th Public Relation Administration and 18th Director, I always proactively take participation in international affairs like taking a courtesy visit to Malaysian Friendship and Trade Centre on 28 November 2014 then learn more about diplomatic and trade missions from His Excellency Ambassador Datuk T.S. Yong. From this visiting, I really explored my global perspective forward this modern world and started to find out my special personalities on creating attractive conversation.   	Moreover, I had various experiences on being a receptionist from my school club because we usually have to do campus or library guide in English for those scholars and students came from our sister schools. Specifically, we hosted a hi-tea reception for University of Macau Public Relations Student Ambassador on 26 June 2015. Except for the brief introduction of the school history, we also spent the whole afternoon sharing interesting culture differences and the beauty of two countries. In order to prepare well on being facilitator, I took a lot of efforts on researching information of Taiwan then got to know my beloved country more and more deeper.","0","U221683661","李積慧",="0937-512-289","1",

The university life gives me the opportunities to enlarge my life experience and to develop my critical competence. With great interest in the study of language, I had the chance to be admitted in LungHwa University of Science and Technology’s excellent program. As part of the requirements, I lived and study in America for a semester; so far I had the opportunity to experience about the American life from observing my peers, my professors, and the general environment.  	Compared to the college, my graduate school life is more colorful and meaningful. I participated in many students’ clubs, including volunteer service learning, English performance, and study group. I really learn much from these groups and made friends with a lot of people from different backgrounds. Through the cooperation and exchange with them, I realized that there are so many special people in the world so that everyone has to be humble and open-minded. On the other hand, I tried to figure out how to do the meaningful learning on my studies. There are many differences between college and graduate school life, I knew that it is a treasury here, but how can I find the key to opening it? I began to ponder on my learning attitudes and styles. In order to learn some professional counseling skills, I worked in cram school as a part-time job, and then to be a teaching assistant there. Through this previous experience, I realized how working was, learned how to react to students and talk to children’s parents and on the phone. Through this part-time job, I understand myself much better and I decided to be a teacher in the future. In this way, I not only can continue my English learning, but also I can devote myself to education.","","0","lead0409","邱惠敏",="0915807830","0",

The treatment has then been applied to many Jewish people and their families both in Taiwan and Israel and proved very effective by them.
